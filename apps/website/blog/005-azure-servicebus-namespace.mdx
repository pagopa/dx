# Introducing the 'Azure Service Bus Namespace' Terraform Module and Usage Patterns to Facilitate Service Bus Setup

The new Terraform module
[`Azure Service Bus Namespace`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-service-bus-namespace/azurerm/latest)
has been released by the DevEx team to enable customers to easily and
straightforwardly set up Service Bus!

This module abstracts inner complexities such as networking, authentication, and
scaling. By choosing the `l` tier (which matches the `Premium` SKU), the module
provides private communication via private endpoints and also includes an
autoscaler resource to dynamically change the number of instances depending on
CPU and memory metrics.

The module also supports the `m` tier (`Standard` SKU), but it is recommended to
use this tier only in test environments as the resource cannot be isolated in
terms of networking and remains on the public internet.

## Getting Started

We recommend referencing the module via the Terraform Registry and pinning the
version to the latest stable release:

```hcl
module "sbns" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-service-bus-namespace/azurerm"
  version = "~>0.0"
}
```

Roles can be managed through the traditional
[role assignment module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm/latest),
which you should already be familiar with. By passing names of queues, topics,
and subscriptions, the IAM complexity is taken away.

```hcl
module "roles" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm"
  version = "~>1.0"

  principal_id    = <principal_id>
  subscription_id = data.azurerm_subscription.current.subscription_id

  service_bus = [
    {
      namespace_name      = <value>
      resource_group_name = <value>
      role                = "reader|writer|owner"
      description         = <value>
      queue_names         = (optional) [<list of queues>]
      topic_names         = (optional) [<list of topics>]
      subscriptions = {
        (optional) <list of key-value pairs for subscriptions, e.g. topic = [<list of subscriptions>]>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Additionally, the
[Azure Bootstrap module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-github-environment-bootstrap/azurerm/latest)
has been updated to add the needed roles to apply Terraform code to a
centralized Service Bus instance, if you have one.

More details can be found in the documentation, which is available in the
[module entry in the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-service-bus-namespace/azurerm/latest).

Moreover, if you want to learn more about best practices and patterns, check out
[DX guidelines](https://dx.pagopa.it/docs/infrastructure/azure/using-service-bus).
