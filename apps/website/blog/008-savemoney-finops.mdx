Cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control. Forgotten **virtual machines**,
**unattached disks**, idle **App Service Plans**—these _"ghost resources"_
accumulate over time, silently draining budgets. To address this challenge, the
DX team has built **SaveMoney**, a tool integrated into the DX CLI that helps
teams identify and optimize cloud spending without breaking a sweat.

SaveMoney is **read-only, metric-driven, and intelligent**. It doesn't delete or
modify anything—instead, it generates detailed reports to support informed
FinOps decisions.

## The Problem: Hidden Cloud Waste

In large cloud environments, it's easy to lose track of resources:

- A developer spins up a VM for testing and forgets to deallocate it
- An App Service Plan remains active after all apps are removed
- Disks persist after VMs are deleted
- Public IPs sit idle with no associated resources

These scenarios are common across organizations, and they add up to significant
unnecessary costs. Traditional cloud cost management tools often rely on simple
heuristics or require manual tagging—neither of which provides the full picture.

## The Solution: Metric-Based Analysis

SaveMoney takes a **data-driven approach** to cost optimization by analyzing
actual Azure Monitor metrics over configurable time periods. Instead of guessing
whether a resource is unused, it examines:

- **CPU utilization** for Virtual Machines and App Service Plans
- **Network traffic** for VMs, Public IPs, and Static Web Apps
- **Memory consumption** for App Service Plans and Container Apps
- **Transaction counts** for Storage Accounts
- **Deployment state** for Container Apps and App Service Plans

This metric-based detection provides high confidence in the results, reducing
false positives and helping teams focus on truly wasteful resources.

## Architecture & Multi-Cloud Vision

SaveMoney follows a modular architecture designed for **multi-cloud support**:

Currently, **Azure is the primary supported cloud provider**, with comprehensive
analysis for common resource types. AWS support is planned for future releases.
The architecture separates cloud-specific analyzers from the core logic, making
it straightforward to add new providers and expand coverage.

:::note Continuous Improvement

The Azure analyzer is actively evolving. We're continuously refining detection
logic, adding support for additional resource types, and improving metric-based
thresholds based on real-world feedback.

:::

## What SaveMoney Detects

SaveMoney currently analyzes **9 common Azure resource types**, focusing on the
ones that typically drive the most cloud waste:

- **High Cost Risk**: Virtual Machines (deallocated or idle), App Service Plans
  (empty or oversized)
- **Medium Cost Risk**: Orphaned Disks, unused Public IPs, idle Network
  Interfaces, disconnected Private Endpoints, low-traffic Storage Accounts and
  Container Apps
- **Low Cost Risk**: Static Web Apps with minimal traffic

Each resource is evaluated using a combination of **state checks** (is it
attached? running?) and **Azure Monitor metrics** (CPU usage, network traffic,
transactions) to minimize false positives.

the
[official documentation](https://dx.pagopa.it/docs/dx-cli#savemoney--cost-optimization).

## Getting Started

SaveMoney is available as part of the `@pagopa/dx-cli` toolchain. Here's how to
use it:

:::info Early Stage

SaveMoney is currently in its initial version. The CLI interface and available
commands will evolve over time with additional filters, output options, and
workflow integrations based on user feedback and real-world usage.

:::

### Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription(s)** with appropriate permissions
- **Azure CLI authentication**
- **Node.js 22 or higher**

### Installation

You can invoke the CLI directly via `npx` without installing globally, and if
you're already using the DX CLI, SaveMoney is included:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney --help
```

When installed locally in a monorepo you can also run:

```bash
pnpm dx savemoney --help
```

### Configuration Options

SaveMoney supports multiple configuration methods to fit different workflows:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="config-file" label="Config File" default>

Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `config.json`):

```json
{
  "tenantId": "your-tenant-id",
  "subscriptionIds": ["subscription-id-1", "subscription-id-2"],
  "preferredLocation": "italynorth",
  "timespanDays": 30
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney --config config.json
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="env-vars" label="Environment Variables">

Set environment variables:

```bash
export ARM_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="subscription-id-1,subscription-id-2"
```

Then run:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli-options" label="CLI Options">

Pass options directly via command line:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney \
  --config config.json \
  --format table \
  --location italynorth \
  --days 30 \
  --verbose
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="interactive" label="Interactive Prompt">

If no configuration is provided, SaveMoney will prompt you interactively:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney
# Enter Tenant ID: your-tenant-id
# Enter Subscription IDs (comma-separated): sub-1,sub-2
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Output Formats

SaveMoney offers three output formats to suit different use cases:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON Format">

Standard JSON output for integration with other tools or CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney --format json
```

**Example output:**

```json
[
  {
    "costRisk": "high",
    "location": "italynorth",
    "name": "vm-test-01",
    "reason": "Low CPU usage (avg 0.57%). Low network traffic (0.06 MB/day avg).",
    "resourceGroup": "rg-test",
    "subscriptionId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "suspectedUnused": true,
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
  }
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="table" label="Table Format">

A human-readable summary perfect for terminal viewing:

```bash
npx @pagopa/dx-cli savemoney --format table
```

**Example output:**

```
