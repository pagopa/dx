# Benchmark for Typescript Code Generators from OpenAPI

The digital services we provide interact through REST APIs that are documented
using OpenAPI specifications.

Using API clients requires the code that handles HTTP requests and responses to
strictly adhere to the OpenAPI specifications. This is crucial to ensure that
the exchanged data is valid and consistent with the defined schemas. Similarly,
when providing APIs through NodeJS services, such as Express or similar
frameworks, it is important to follow the same standards. This ensures that the
APIs are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

The purpose of this document is to evaluate and compare various TypeScript
OpenAPI generators for both frontend and backend development. The evaluation
will focus on critical features and help determine whether to invest in a custom
tool (make) or adopt an existing tool.

## Guiding Principles

### Main Requirements

1. **Runtime Payload Control** The generators must provide runtime controls on
   the payloads to ensure data integrity and adherence to defined schemas. We
   believe runtime control is necessary to guarantee that the Typescript type
   matches the actual structure of the payload. Without this, there's a higher
   chance of runtime errors due to discrepancies in the data format.

2. **Generation of Isomorphic Types** The ability to generate types usable both
   on the client and server sides (e.g., in Express route handlers).

3. **Support for String Patterns (Regex)** Generators must support string
   patterns using regular expressions to enforce constraints on string values.

4. **Support for JSON Schema Constraints** For example, the handling of
   constraints such as minimum, maximum, exclusiveMinimum, and exclusiveMaximum
   is essential for validating numeric data.

5. **Community and Maintainability** A strong community and/or easily
   maintainable codebase are crucial for the long-term viability and support of
   the generator.

### Additional Features (Nice to Have)

1. **Support for Security Headers** Generators should support security headers
   to enhance API security.

2. **Support for File Uploads** The ability to handle file uploads seamlessly
   within the API.

3. **Support for File Downloads (Octet Stream)** There must be support for file
   downloads, specifically as an octet stream.

4. **Minimal Footprint** Generators should aim for minimal footprint, e.g.,
   generating one type per file with tree-shaking capabilities to optimize
   performance.

5. **Developer Experience** High performance during code generation is
   important. The generator should be fast and not slow down the IDE, even
   during type inference.

## Comparison

- **typed-openapi**: Converts to Typescript before converting to runtime types
  (typebox-codegen → zod), losing information on constraints.
- **openapi-generator**: Runtime checks are limited to verifying if the value is
  defined.
- **swagger-codegen**: An older version of openapi-generator.
- **autorest**: Seems promising on paper, but couldn't get it to start (freezes
  on startup).
- **openapi-io-ts**: Inexistent community, doesn't work with our specs, not
  maintained.
- **orval**: Primarily targets React; generates code that works on our specs.

| Generator         | Server Types | Community | Supports Regex (Pattern String) | Supports Min/Max (Number) | Supports HTTP Headers |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| typed-openapi     | Yes          | Yes       | No                              | No                        | Yes                   |
| openapi-generator | Yes          | Yes       | No                              | No                        | Yes                   |
| swagger-codegen   | Yes          | Yes       | No                              | No                        | Yes                   |
| autorest          | ???          | Yes       | ???                             | ???                       | ???                   |
| openapi-io-ts     | ???          | No        | ???                             | ???                       | ???                   |
| orval             | No           | Yes       | Yes                             | Yes                       | Yes                   |

## Exclusion Criteria

Some tools are excluded from this benchmark due to lack of runtime controls (at
least, as of the writing of this document):

- heyapi
- oazapfts
- openapi-backend
- openapi-typescript
- swagger-typescript-api

Although it is possible to translate the generated Typescript types into
structures (e.g., zod/typebox) that allow runtime controls, this kind of
conversion results in a loss of information on constraints (e.g., maximum,
minimum, maxLength, pattern, etc.).

## Generated Code Repository

A repository is available to compare the code of different generators:
[GitHub - gunzip/openapi-generator-benchmark](https://github.com/gunzip/openapi-generator-benchmark)

## Issues with openapi-zod-client

1. Inaccurate type generation.
2. Poor performance in the IDE due to type inference from the single object
   passed to the zodios `makeApi` method.
3. Dependency on `@zodios/core` for HTTP calls (via Axios), parameter
   validation, and query string handling.
4. Does not support multiple successful values (2xx codes).
5. Both the client and types are contained in a single file, making it hard to
   optimize the bundle (important for frontend clients).
6. The maintainer of zodios has been inactive for a while.

### Example of Inaccurate Type Generation

```typescript
const MessageSubject = z.string();
const MessageBodyMarkdown = z.string();
const MessageContent = z
  .object({
    subject: MessageSubject.min(10).max(120).optional(),
    markdown: MessageBodyMarkdown.min(80).max(10000),
  })
  .passthrough();
```

Generated from the foloowing OpenAPI schema:

```yaml
MessageSubject:
      type: string
      minLength: 10
      maxLength: 120
    MessageBodyMarkdown:
      type: string
      minLength: 80
      maxLength: 10000
          MessageContent:
      type: object
    MessageContent:
      properties:
        subject:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/MessageSubject"
        markdown:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/MessageBodyMarkdown"
      required:
        - markdown
```

## Issues with swagger-typescript-api + ts-to-zod

Unlike other Typescript type generators, `swagger-typescript-api` retains
information on constraints (minimum, maximum, maxLength, pattern, etc.) in JSDoc
comments associated with type definitions. This allows for the reconstruction of
runtime schemas, for example, using tools like `ts-to-zod`. However:

1. The generated runtime schemas are separate from the client code, so the
   “plumbing” to connect the runtime validation (ts-to-zod) to the generated
   types (`swagger-typescript-api`) must be implemented manually.
2. Types are not always accurate due to discrepancies between the annotations
   generated by swagger-typescript-api and those expected by ts-to-zod (e.g.,
   `@min` vs `@minimum`).
3. Some inaccuracies in type generation produce invalid Typescript code.

Nevertheless, the zod schemas are more faithful than those generated by
openapi-zod-client.

### Example of Accurate Type Generation

```typescript
export const messageSubjectSchema = z.string().min(10).max(120);
export const messageBodyMarkdownSchema = z.string().min(80).max(10000);
export const messageContentSchema = z.object({
  subject: messageSubjectSchema.optional(),
  markdown: messageBodyMarkdownSchema,
});
```

## Conclusion

As of Jun 2024, no OpenAPI generator fully meets our guiding principles. While
`openapi-zod-client` seems to cover most of the desired features, it still
appears to be an immature project, not always accurate in type generation.

It is appropriate to invest in the development of a Typescript code generator
from OpenAPI that performs correct and complete runtime checks.
