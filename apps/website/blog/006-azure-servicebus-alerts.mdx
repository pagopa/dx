# Introducing the **Azure Service Bus Alerts** Terraform Module

The new Terraform module
[`Azure Service Bus Alerts`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-service-bus-dlq-alert/azurerm/latest)
has been released to help teams monitor their Azure Service Bus instances with
minimal setup and improved observability.

This module allows teams to configure alerts for both **active** and
**dead-lettered messages** across queues and topics, providing flexibility
through customizable thresholds, severities, and metric windows.

It is designed to integrate easily with your existing Service Bus namespaces and
can be customized through simple input variables. Multiple entities can be
monitored at once, and alert actions can be routed to one or more Azure Monitor
Action Groups.

## Getting Started

We recommend referencing the module via the Terraform Registry and pinning the
version to the latest stable release:

```hcl
module "alerts" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-service-bus-dlq-alert/azurerm"
  version = "~> 0.0"

  environment = {
    prefix          = "example"
    env_short       = "d"
    location        = "westeurope"
    app_name        = "myapp"
    instance_number = "01"
  }

  service_bus_namespace_id = azurerm_servicebus_namespace.example.id

  alerts_on_dlq_messages = {
    description   = "DLQ messages alert"
    entity_names  = ["queue1", "topic1"]
    threshold     = 5
    severity      = "Error"
    check_every   = "PT5M"
    lookback_period = "PT10M"
  }

  alerts_on_active_messages = {
    description   = "Active messages alert"
    entity_names  = ["queue1", "topic1"]
    threshold     = 20
    severity      = "Warning"
    check_every   = "PT15M"
    lookback_period = "PT30M"
  }

  action_group_ids = [azurerm_monitor_action_group.example.id]
  tags             = local.tags
}
```
