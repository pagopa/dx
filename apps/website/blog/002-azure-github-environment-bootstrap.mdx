# Introducing the 'Azure GitHub Environment Bootstrap' Terraform Module to Enhance New Project Startup

The new Terraform module
[`Azure GitHub Environment Bootstrap`](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/infra/modules/azure_github_environment_bootstrap)
developed by the DevEx team, has finally left the beta status by reaching its
first major version release!

This module is useful for anybody that has just created a new repository and
wants to focus quickly on their goals rather than spending hours in setting up
everything around the new repository. The module focuses on projects which
leverage Azure, GitHub, and a single environment (production). After applying
this module, the repository will have:

- completed the setup needed to launch **GitHub Actions** workflows
- a dedicated private **GitHub Runner** to connect to private Azure resources
  from GitHub pipelines
- an Azure **resource group** to deploy resources generally contained in
  `infra/resources`
- the **required permissions** to operate on domain resources
- a secure and smooth configuration

To accomplish the setup, the module provisions:

- an Azure Container App Job to run workflows in a private **GitHub Runner**
  integrated with an Azure VNet
- a federation between the GitHub repository and Azure user-assigned **managed
  identities** to allow workflows to connect with Azure tenant
- the creation of a project-specific Azure resource group which will contain the
  infrastructure of the entire repository as it will share the same lifecycle
  and IAM setup
- the IAM setup of both team and Azure user-assigned managed identities
  following the [latest DevEx framework](../docs/infrastructure/azure/azure-iam)
- the GitHub repository settings according to the best practices found by the DX
  team

As the `Azure GitHub Environment Bootstrap` module is designed to support teams
in new project development, it is particularly indicated for mono repositories
which traditionally require more time to be properly prepared: in just a few
minutes, the repository will be ready to be used.

On the other hand, the new module may be a bit overwhelming for small
repositories, where you may have only one application. For this reason, the
module
[`azure_federated_identity_with_github`](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/infra/modules/azure_federated_identity_with_github)
is still maintained and available, and is suggested for those cases. However,
please note that this design is not advisable, and instead, the use of mono
repositories is recommended.

## Getting Started

We recommend to reference the module via the Terraform Registry, and pin the
version to the latest stable release:

```hcl
module "repo" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-github-environment-bootstrap/azurerm"
  version = "~>1.0"
}
```

Despite the `Azure GitHub Environment Bootstrap` module requiring a lot of
inputs, its usage remains easy. In fact, a lot of values are the same for
different projects under the same product's umbrella, and moreover are
well-known by our user base. The following data is requested:

- the Azure subscription and tenant IDs
- the IDs of team-specific Entra ID groups as expected by
  [DevEx IAM framework](../docs/infrastructure/azure/azure-iam)
- the ID of an existing Azure Container App Environment
- the details of the Storage Account holding the Terraform state file
- the details of the current repository (name, description, topics, optionally
  reviewers, etc.)
- the IDs of the product-shared cloud resources, if any (API Management, Private
  Endpoints, VNet, etc.)

More details about the usage can be found in the documentation, which is
available in the
[module entry in the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-github-environment-bootstrap/azurerm/latest).
