# Working with Containers

Containers provides consistent, portable, and scalable environments. Our DX
tools support the full container lifecycle, from development to production and
maintenance, ensuring your containerized applications are built, deployed, and
managed efficiently.

## Container Best Practices

✅ **Use Multi-Stage Builds** - Reduce image size and attack surface  
✅ **Scan for Vulnerabilities** - Integrate security scanning in your pipeline  
✅ **Follow Least Privilege** - Run containers with minimal required
permissions  
✅ **Implement Health Checks** - Ensure container reliability  
✅ **Use Orchestration** - Leverage AWS Fargate or Azure Container Apps for
production deployments

## 🏗️ **Build & Package Containers**

DX Tools provide robust support for building and packaging container images,
ensuring your applications are containerized efficiently and securely.
