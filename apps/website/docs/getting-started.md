# Getting Started

Getting started with DX tooling can sometimes feel overwhelming, as it covers a
wide range of scenarios. This page provides initial guidance to help understand
core concepts and start using DX tools effectively.

## Key Concepts to Know

We know you're eager to dive in and start coding, but spending a few minutes on
this section will save you from getting stuck later ðŸ«·.

### Mono Repositories: yes please!

Using a mono repository is mandatory to adopt DX tooling, as several components
are designed on that assumption.
[Mono repos offer several advantages](https://pagopa.github.io/technology-radar/methods-and-patterns/monorepo.html),
and DX tools are designed with them in mind.

### Supported Platforms

DX tools are built to work seamlessly with GitHub and multiple Cloud Service
Providers (CSPs).

:::info

Currently, Azure is the only supported CSP. However, we are actively working on
adding support for AWS as well.

:::

### Terraform Modules

All DX Terraform modules are available on
[the public Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/pagopa-dx)
under the `pagopa-dx` organization.

Keep in mind
[you can contribute](https://pagopa.github.io/dx/docs/infrastructure/contributing-to-dx-terraform-modules/)
to improve them.

### DX Design Principles

DX tools are designed to make teams
[autonomous in their daily work](index.md#how-this-differs-from-technology-standards-iniative)
by providing golden paths and best practices. They don't need to understand how
the tools work internallyâ€”though everything is open source and
[contributions are welcome](https://pagopa.github.io/dx/docs/conventions/pull-requests/acceptance-criteria).
Instead, they can focus on delivering value.

DX also provides guidance to help teams adopt useful conventions during their
journey:

- [Optimize Git](./conventions/git/index.md) usage.
- [Create effective Pull Requests](./conventions/pull-requests/index.md).
- [Name Azure resources](./conventions/azure-naming-convention.md) consistently.
- [Organize repository folders](./conventions/infra-folder-structure.md) for
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) sources.

## Start Team First Project

Define boundaries for team services and plan how to split team projects. Once
ready, create a repository on GitHub and
[configure it using DX tooling](./infrastructure/monorepository-setup.md).

## Set Up Team First GitHub Workflows

The DX repository
[provides several templates](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/.github) -
all [properly documented](./pipelines/index.md) - to speed up continuous
integration and delivery for team apps and IaC code. These templates cover
various scenarios, such as TypeScript code validation, web app deployment
(including FaaS!), building and pushing Docker images to
[GitHub registry](https://github.com/orgs/pagopa/packages?repo_name=dx), and
more. Feel free to choose the ones that best suit team needs!

## Explore More Resources

If DX tooling is appreciated, there's much more to discover on this website:

- **Articles**: Guidance for common use cases.
- **Conventions**: Predefined conventions to better organize resources.
- **Infrastructure**: DX tooling for cloud-related topics.
- **Pipelines**: DX tooling for GitHub Actions.
