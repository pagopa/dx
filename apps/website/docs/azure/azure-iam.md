# Managing Azure IAM Roles and Permissions

## Overview

Understanding Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions
is crucial for developer teams to securely and efficiently manage access to
cloud resources while maintaining the least privilege principles.

In order to ensure a clear separation of concerns and resource ownership, as DX
team, we have defined a set of guidelines and best practices for managing IAM
roles and permissions in Azure.

## Roles and Permissions

We propose a role-based access control (RBAC) model that leverages Azure Entra
ID groups to manage access to Azure resources. Each team will have three Entra
ID security groups:

- Admins (domain experts)
- Developers (regular team members)
- Externals (contractors)

This segmentation allows for appropriate access levels based on role
responsibilities and trust levels. Each team is responsible and autonomous on
how to split members among these groups by making PRs on
[eng-azure-authorization](https://github.com/pagopa/eng-azure-authorization/tree/main/src/azure-subscriptions/subscriptions)
repository.

This section outlines the IAM configuration for each Entra ID group.

### Subscription-Level Access

#### Admin Group

- `Contributor` role on the subscription: can view and manage all resources
- Can assist in emergency situations and manage cross-team resources

#### Developer Group

- `Reader` role on the subscription: can view all resources but cannot modify
  them
- Provides an overview of the broader infrastructure context

#### External Group

- `Reader` role on the subscription (same as Developer group)
- Can understand the system architecture while maintaining security

### Resource Group-Level Access

#### Team-Specific Resource Groups

While subscriptions may be shared across teams, resource groups are owned and
managed by a single team.

##### Admin Group

- `Owner` role: full control over all resources within the group
- Can manage IAM assignments within the group
- Can manage resource locks
- In Key Vaults using RBAC:
  - `Key Vault Data Access Administrator` role: can manage secrets, keys and
    certificates
  - `Key Vault Administrator` role: can manage resource properties

##### Developer Group

- `Contributor` role: can create and manage resources
- Cannot modify IAM assignments
- Cannot modify resource locks
- In Key Vaults using RBAC:
  - `Key Vault Secrets Officer` role: can manage secrets

##### External Group

- `Reader` (inherited) role: can view resources and configurations
- No modification privileges

#### Shared Resources-Level Access

Some resources are inherently shared across teams due to their nature or
architectural decisions. These include (but are not limited to):

- Application Gateways
- API Management
- Public and Private DNS Zones
- Private Endpoints
- Other product-specific resources

For shared resources, teams must request role assignments through Pull Requests
to the repository where they are defined (generally `<product-name>-infra`).
This process is useful to control access and management of critical resources
with big radius impact.

## Role-Based Access Matrix

The following roles are set up automatically by the Terraform module
`azure_github_environment_bootstrap`. Its usage is strong advised for mono
repositories. The first view is cleaner and easier to read, recommended for
developers.

## Code Examples (How-To) and Common Troubleshooting

### How to label a resource group as team-owned

Create the resource group in `Repository` Terraform configuration of your mono
repository and pass its resource id to the `azure_github_environment_bootstrap`
module via the `additional_resource_group_ids` variable. All roles will be
automatically applied.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```hcl
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "domain_itn_01" {
    name     = "name"
    location = "location"
    tags     = local.tags
  }

  module "repo" {
    source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-github-environment-bootstrap/azurerm"
    version = "~>1.0"

    TBD = [
      azurerm_resource_group.domain_itn_01.id
    ]
  }
```

</details>

### Azure Resources

Understand IAM and assigning the right role in the right way could be difficult.
So, this section shows most common scenarios developers may face.

#### Notes

The label `set by the module` means that the role is already given by the DX
module `azure_github_environment_bootstrap` to Entra ID groups. **Applications
still need a role assignment** (possibly with the narrowest scope).

Code samples should be set next to the resource definition, unless otherwise
specified. The repository can be found in resource tags on Azure Portal.

`Writer` role includes `Reader`, unless otherwise specified.

### Azure APIM

If you get an error about roles while operating on APIM, please add the
`apim_id` optional variable to the `azure_github_environment_bootstrap` by
specifying the APIM instance resource Id.

### Azure Cache for Redis

#### Team-owned Redis

Set by the module

#### Shared Redis

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```hcl
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "" {
  scope                = <redis-id>
  role_definition_name = "Contributor"
  principal_id         = <who-needs-access>
}
```

</details>

### Azure Cosmos DB

In both scenarios, it is mandatory to manually set IAM roles. This approach is
recommended as keys are not secure.

It is also recommended to set roles at container level rather than Cosmos DB
Account, especially for applications and shared Accounts.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```hcl
module "" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm"
  version = "~>0.0"

  principal_id = <who-needs-access>

  cosmos = [
    {
      account_name = <st-target-name>
      resource_group_name  = <st-target-rg-name>
      role                 = "reader" # or writer
    }
  ]
}
```

Optionally set the database and container via optional variables `database` and
`collections`.

</details>

### Azure Event Hub

#### Team-owned Event Hub

Set by the module

#### Shared Event Hub

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```hcl
module "" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm"
  version = "~>0.0"

  principal_id = <who-needs-access>

  event_hub = [
    {
      namespace_name = <st-target-name>
      resource_group_name  = <st-target-rg-name>
      role                 = "reader" # or writer
    }
  ]
}
```

Optionally set the Event Hubs via `event_hub_names` property.

</details>

### Azure Key Vault

#### Team-owned Key Vault

Set by the module if using RBAC access model (recommended).

<details>
  <summary>Enabling RBAC access model to Key Vault</summary>

```hcl
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "" {
  name                = "name"
  location            = "location"
  resource_group_name = "resource-group"

  enable_rbac_authorization = true
}
```

</details>

Otherwise via Access Policies:

<details>
  <summary>Manage Key Vault Access Policies</summary>

```hcl
module "" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm"
  version = "~>0.0"

  principal_id = <who-needs-access>

  key_vault = [
    {
      secrets      = "writer" # or writer or owner
      certificates = "writer" # or writer or owner
      keys         = "writer" # or writer or owner
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

#### Shared Key Vault

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```hcl
module "" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm"
  version = "~>0.0"

  principal_id = <who-needs-access>

  key_vault = [
    {
      secrets      = "writer" # or writer or owner
      certificates = "writer" # or writer or owner
      keys         = "writer" # or writer or owner
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

### Azure NAT Gateway

If you get an error about roles while associating a NAT Gateway to an
AppService/Function App, please add the `nat_gateway_resource_group_id` optional
variable to the `azure_github_environment_bootstrap` by specifying the NAT
Gateways' resource group Id.

### Azure Notification Hub

#### Team-owned Notification Hub

Set by the module

#### Shared Notification Hub

<details>
  <summary>Enable Terraform state access via Entra ID</summary>

```hcl
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "" {
  scope                = <notification-hub-namespace-id>
  role_definition_name = "Contributor"
  principal_id         = <who-needs-access>
}
```

</details>

### Azure Storage Account

It is recommended to use Entra ID authentication to access Storage Accounts,
instead of using keys. In fact, key-based access ignores IAM roles and can be
used by anyone without further authentication.

To set Entra ID authentication as default and disabling key access, set the
properties TBD of the Storage Account DX module.

<details>
  <summary>Enable Terraform state access via Entra ID</summary>

```hcl
backend "azurerm" {
  ...
  `use_azuread_auth` = true
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Enable Storage Account access via Entra ID</summary>

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  storage_use_azuread = true
}

```

</details>

#### Blob

##### Team-owned Storage Account

Set by the module

##### Shared Storage Account

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```hcl
module "" {
  source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-role-assignments/azurerm"

  principal_id = <who-needs-access>

  storage_blob = [
    {
      storage_account_name = <st-target-name>
      resource_group_name  = <st-target-rg-name>
      role                 = "reader" # or writer
    }
  ]
}
```

Optionally set the container name via `container_name` property.

</details>

  storage_queue = [
    {
      storage_account_name = <st-target-name>
      resource_group_name  = <st-target-rg-name>
      role                 = "reader" # or writer

## Best Practices

### Role Usage Guidelines

- Follow least-privilege principle
- Add a brief description in the proper field of the role assignment object when
  available
- Use admin privileges only for critical operations

### Security Considerations

- Avoid connection strings; use managed identities where possible
- Remove unused role assignments
