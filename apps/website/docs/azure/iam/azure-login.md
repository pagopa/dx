# Configuring Azure Login for GitHub Actions

There are several ways to log into Azure using a GitHub Action. The DX-preferred
method is passwordless, requiring no maintenance or secret management. Once set
up, it works seamlessly.

:::tip

DX modules
[`azure_federated_identity_with_github`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-federated-identity-with-github/azurerm/latest)
and
[`azure_github_environment_bootstrap`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-github-environment-bootstrap/azurerm/latest)
already implement the steps described in this article. Both modules provide a
default set of roles in the current Azure subscription, which is likely
sufficient for new repositories. However, the latter also creates the required
GitHub Environments and secrets. If you're already using
`azure_federated_identity_with_github`, you can skip the first section and read
about [GitHub Environments](#github-environments) and
[how to manage multiple environments](#managing-multiple-github-environments).
Instead, `azure_github_environment_bootstrap` users might find it more useful to
read about [best practices for managing Azure IAM](../azure/azure-iam.md).

:::

To enable GitHub Actions to log into Azure, you need only two components:

1. A User-Assigned Azure Managed Identity resource
2. A federation between the Azure Managed Identity and the GitHub repository

Create a User-Assigned Managed Identity using the command:

```bash
az identity create --name <myIdentity> \
  --resource-group <myRg> \
  --location <myLocation> \
  --tags <myTags>
```

:::warning

You need write access (e.g. `Contributor` role) to the resource group set in the
command above

:::

After creating the Managed Identity, retrieve its `client id` and save it for
later use.

:::note

You can obtain the Managed Identity Client ID in the Azure Portal by navigating
to the Managed Identity resource:

Alternatively, you can find it using the Azure CLI:

```bash
az identity show --name <myIdentity> \
  --resource-group <myRg>
```

:::

To federate the identity with GitHub, navigate to the `Federated Credentials`
blade and create a new credential. Select the option
`Configure a GitHub issued token to impersonate this application and deploy to Azure`,
and fill in the required fields. Alternatively, use the Azure CLI:

```bash
az identity federated-credential create --identity-name <federationName> \
  --name <myName> \
  --resource-group <myRg> \
  --audiences "api://AzureADTokenExchange" \
  --issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --subject "repo:{Organization}/{Repository}:{Entity}"
```

Here, `Entity` can be a GitHub `Environment`, `Branch`, `Pull Request`, or
`Tag`.

Your GitHub repository is now federated with the Managed Identity, allowing
GitHub Actions to log into Azure for the specified `Entity`:

```yaml
- name: Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v2
  with:
    client-id: ${{ env.ARM_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ env.ARM_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ env.ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
```

Although the three mentioned values are not secrets, they should not be
hardcoded in the pipeline but stored as repository or GitHub _environment_
secrets. This is because they are likely to be used in multiple workflows and
could change over time.

## GitHub Environments

A GitHub pipeline can use GitHub environments to inherit settings, secrets,
variables, permissions, and other configurations. As Azure subscriptions are
grouped by project (`PROD-IO`, `PROD-SELFCARE`, etc.) and environment
(`DEV-SELFCARE`, `UAT-SELFCARE`, etc.), GitHub environments are used to retrieve
the value of a given secret depending on the current scope, which comprises
both.

The following values can be stored as secrets tied to specific GitHub
environments:

- `ARM_TENANT_ID`: This value is constant and can be stored as a repository
  secret.
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: If the project has a single environment, store it as a
  repository secret; otherwise, use an environment secret.
- `ARM_CLIENT_ID`: Always store this as an environment secret.

:::tip

GitHub environments and secrets can be created via Terraform using the
[provided DX module](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/repository).

:::

### Managing Multiple GitHub Environments

A Managed Identity has a set of roles within a given subscription. Multiple
pipelines requiring the same roles can share the same Managed Identity and
GitHub environment.

Consider a scenario where a repository has two Azure Functions Apps, each with
its own application code and Terraform code. The Terraform deployments require
high privileges to create and update networking resources, identities, key vault
secrets, and more. On the other hand, the roles required for the Function App
deployments are limited to write access for the Function App resource control
plane. These deployments do not need access to other resources such as
networking, storage, or secrets. However, both Function Apps require the same
roles as the action performed is identical.

In this case, the two Function App pipelines can share the same Managed Identity
and the related GitHub environment. However, the Terraform code should point to
a dedicated GitHub environment.

:::tip

The following naming convention is generally used for GitHub environments:

- `infra-<env>-ci/cd`: For Infrastructure as Code (Terraform HCL) (e.g.,
  `infra-prod-ci`)
- `app-<env>-ci/cd`: For application deployments (e.g., Azure Functions or App
  Services)
- `opex-<env>-ci/cd`: For Opex dashboard deployments

For other needs, create environments following this pattern.

## Managing Identity Roles

The module
[`azure_federated_identity_with_github`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/pagopa-dx/azure-federated-identity-with-github/azurerm/latest)
assigns a default set of roles. However, these roles may need to be updated over
time.

This can happen when, for example, a new resource is added to the configuration
that requires special roles. Or when the Terraform code needs to read a secret
from a new KeyVault or access blobs from a new Storage Account. It is impossible
to anticipate all possible cases, as things change over time.

Therefore, it is important to update the identity definition with the
appropriate roles whenever a new role is needed. There are numerous scenarios
where this could occur, but some common examples include:

- Modify roles for system-assigned managed identities
- Access new entities in a KeyVault (e.g., certificates, secrets, or keys)
- Add VNet peerings
- Update APIM configurations
- Read from a Storage Account container, queue, or table

The general advice is to check the CI pipeline, as it may fail due to a missing
role. In such cases, identify the required role using the official documentation
and create a pull request (PR) with the updated definition.

:::warning

Setting new roles is straightforward but must be done separately for CI and CD
identities.

:::

:::tip

Roles are assigned at the subscription and resource group levels. Refer to the
module documentation for details.
