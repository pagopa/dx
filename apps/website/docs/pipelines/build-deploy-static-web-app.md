# Deploy Static Site to Azure Static Web App Workflow

The
[Build and Deploy Static Site to Azure Static Web App](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/.github/workflows/release-azure-staticapp-v1.yaml)
is a reusable workflow (`workflow_call`) that automates the build and deployment
of a static application from a Turborepo-based monorepo to **Azure Static Web
Apps**. It is designed to provide a streamlined, secure, and consistent
deployment process, complete with integrated support for **Pull Request
previews**.

## How It Works

The workflow automates the entire deployment process from build to release.

1. Automatically identifies the package manager used in the project (pnpm, yarn,
   or npm), configures the runner accordingly and builds the application using
   `turbo build` command.
2. It uses the official `Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1` action to upload the
   built application.
3. If the workflow is triggered by a Pull Request, the deployment step
   automatically creates a temporary preview environment, allowing you to see
   your changes live before merging.

## Usage

To use this reusable workflow, you need to call it from another workflow file in
your repository. Below is an example of how to trigger it for a specific
application.

```yaml
name: Deploy My Static App to Azure

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "apps/my-static-app/**" # Trigger only when this app changes
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "apps/my-static-app/**"

jobs:
  deploy_to_static_web_app:
    uses: pagopa/dx/.github/workflows/release-azure-staticapp-v1.yaml@main # Path to the reusable workflow
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      workspace_name: "my-static-app" # The 'name' from the app's package.json
      output_dir: "dist" # The build output directory name
      static_web_app_name: "your-static-web-app-name"
      resource_group_name: "your-resource-group-name"
      environment: "app-dev"
```

### Important Notes

1. **Trigger Configuration**: The calling workflow must be triggered on `push`
   and `pull_request` events for the preview environment functionality to work
   correctly.
2. **Workspace Name**: Ensure the `workspace_name` input matches the `name`
   field in the `package.json` of the application you want to deploy, not its
   directory path.
3. **Permissions & Secrets**: The calling workflow must have the necessary
   permissions (`id-token: write`, `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`) and
   secrets (e.g., for Azure login) available. Using `secrets: inherit` is the
   easiest way to pass them down. Make sure the Azure Identity have the
   `PagoPA Static Web Apps List Secrets` role assigned.
4. **Monorepo Structure**: This workflow is optimized for a monorepo managed
   with Turborepo. It assumes your applications are located in workspaces (under
   an `apps/` directory).
