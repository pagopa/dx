# Building with TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://pagopa.github.io/technology-radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript.html)
powers our projects across the board, driving robust REST APIs on the backend
and dynamic web and mobile experiences on the frontend.

Embrace TypeScript over JavaScript wherever possible: its strong typing not only
empowers developers to build with confidence but also enables AI to refine and
evolve our codebases safely and predictably.

Our DX tools are tailored for TypeScript excellence, relying on a solid monorepo
foundation ([monorepo setup](../monorepository-setup.md)) and consistent npm
script naming ([npm scripts conventions](./npm-scripts.md)).

This setup unlocks powerful features, such as our streamlined DX code review
pipeline for TypeScript projects ([TypeScript code review](./code-review.md)).
