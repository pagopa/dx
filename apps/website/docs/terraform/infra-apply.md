# Deploying Infrastructure Changes

This document describes the GitHub workflow that automates Terraform apply
operations.

## Overview

The `infra_apply` workflow is part of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution
and is responsible for executing a `terraform apply` to implement infrastructure
changes.

It uses the OIDC authentication provider for Azure and is configured to manage
the application of changes across different environments.

## Use Cases

- Implement infrastructure changes in specific environments
- Deploy resources after approval
- Automate infrastructure provisioning

## Input

| `env_vars`                    | List of environment variables to set up, given in `env=value` format                             | string  |     | N/A     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | --- | ------- |
| `environment`                 | Environment where the resources will be deployed                                                 | string  | ✓   |         |
| `base_path`                   | Base path where to look for Terraform projects                                                   | string  | ✓   |         |
| `env_vars`                    | List of environment variables to set up, given in `env=value` format                             | string  |     |         |
| `use_private_agent`           | Use a private agent to run the Terraform plan                                                    | boolean |     | `false` |
| `override_github_environment` | Set a value if GitHub Environment name is different from the TF environment folder               | string  |     | `''`    |
| `use_labels`                  | Use labels to start the right environment's GitHub runner                                        | boolean |     | `false` |
| `override_labels`             | Needed for special cases where the environment alone is not sufficient as a distinguishing label | string  |     | `''`    |

## How it Works

The workflow executes the following steps:

1. Determines the Terraform version to use from the `.terraform-version` file
2. Checks the validity of terraform modules locks
3. Configures the environment and Azure credentials
4. Executes a Terraform plan and saves it as an artifact
5. Asks for approval to proceed with the apply operation
6. If approved, applies the previously generated Terraform plan

## Usage Example

```yaml
jobs:
  apply_infra:
    uses: pagopa/dx/.github/workflows/infra_apply.yaml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      environment: prod
      base_path: infra/resources
      # Optional parameters
      env_vars: ""
      use_private_agent: true
      override_github_environment: pe-prod
      use_labels: true
      override_labels: ""
```

## Special configurations (multi environment/multi cloud)

When working with complex infrastructure setups across multiple environments,
you may need to customize how the workflow runs:

- Use `override_github_environment` when your GitHub environments have different
  naming conventions than your Terraform directory structure, like mapping a
  `prod` terraform directory to a `pe-prod` GitHub environment.
- Enable `use_labels` along with `use_private_agent: true` when you need to
  target specific self-hosted runners within specific cloud environments.
  Particularly useful for multi environment projects.
- Set `override_labels` when you need more granular runner selection beyond the
  environment name, such as for region-specific or cloud-specific runners (e.g.,
  "codebuild-prod-project").

These options are particularly useful for projects with complex deployment
strategies across multiple cloud providers or subscriptions.

## Complete Workflow

The typical execution flow in a CI/CD process includes:

1. **Pull Request**: the `infra_plan` workflow is triggered to verify the
   proposed changes
2. **Review & Approval**: reviewers examine the plan and approve the changes
3. **Merge**: after approval, the PR is merged into the main branch
4. **Deploy**: this `infra_apply` workflow is triggered to implement the changes
   in the desired environment
