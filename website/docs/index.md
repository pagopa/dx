# Developer Experience Initiative

## What this is all about

Whether it's your first day or you've been an engineer at PagoPA for years, your
goal is to make an impact. However, the multitude of tools, platforms, and
processes can be overwhelming.

Don't worry, we've all been there! This initiative aims to make your journey as
smooth and enjoyable as possible.

You probably want to start writing your first API or building your first UI
components as soon as you can. To do that, you need to know how to:

- **Structure** your work (e.g., monorepo vs. polyrepo).
- **Architect** your services using the right PaaS.
- **Configure** your services using Infrastructure as Code.
- **Deploy** your application logic to production.
- **Monitor** your services and troubleshoot issues.
- **Secure** your services and manage permissions efficiently.

All of this, ensuring everything is efficient and scalable.

Making these decisions can be time-consuming and complex. The
[Developer Experience Initiative](https://github.com/pagopa/dx) (DX) is here to
help you with _golden paths_ and best practices.

The [DX team](https://github.com/orgs/pagopa/teams/engineering-team-devex) is
available to support you if you choose to adopt these golden paths. However,
you're always free to make your own choices, though this might require more time
and effort and you may miss out on some of the benefits of this support.

This initiative is designed to tackle these challenges and simplify your daily
work, no matter how long you've been with us. It's our way of saying, "Welcome
aboard! We're here to help you shine." With the right information at your
fingertips, you'll confidently navigate our tech ecosystem, solving problems and
creating effective solutions.

## DX in practice

- **Golden Paths**: We provide golden paths, aligned with our
  [Technology Radar](https://pagopa.github.io/technology-radar/index.html), to
  help you avoid wasting precious effort on unnecessary choices.
- **Tools**: We offer tools (e.g., Terraform abstractions) to help you follow
  technology standards easily.
- **Training**: We conduct workshops and training to help you understand and
  apply golden paths and best practices.
- **Support**: We offer concrete support to help you apply these guidelines and
  best practices in your daily work.

## Current status

We're currently working on the following:

- [ ] Github Actions to apply changes to Azure resources
- [ ] Terraform abstractions to deploy Typescript applicative on Azure
- [ ] Templates for Typescript applicative (serverless, express, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation for the above items

If you wonder why we're working on these specific items, check out our
[Achitecture decision records](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/decisions).
