# Pull Request

Pull requests (PRs) are a critical part of the development workflow, enabling
collaboration and code review.

Establishing conventions for PRs ensures clarity and consistency, making it
easier for team members to understand and review changes.

## General Principles

### Transparency

Transparency is crucial in the development process.
[Opening pull requests in draft mode](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
is encouraged to provide visibility into ongoing work and foster collaboration.
While draft PRs can facilitate early feedback, it is the author's responsibility
to request it when needed.

### Pragmatic Minimalism

Adopting a pragmatic minimalism approach means keeping pull requests small and
focused on a single purpose. Avoid unnecessary complexity, and ensure clear PR
descriptions and commit messages to help reviewers understand the intent
quickly.
