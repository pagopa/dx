# Auto Merge

[Auto-merge is a powerful feature in GitHub](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-04-pull-request-auto-merge-is-now-generally-available/) that allows pull requests to be merged automatically once they meet the required conditions, such as passing all status checks (CI pipeline, dependency with another PR, ...) or having approvals from the designated reviewers.  
This feature simplifies the development process, reduces manual work, and ensures code is merged automatically when ready, saving time and avoiding delays.  

## Benefits of Auto Merge

- **Time Saving**: removes the need for manual intervention once the PR meets the conditions
- **Consistency**: it ensures that only code that passes all tests and reviews gets merged, maintaining high quality
- **Reduces the time to production**: by automating the merge process, code could be deployed faster
