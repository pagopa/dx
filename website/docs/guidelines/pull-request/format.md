# Format for Pull Requests

This document outlines the required format for pull requests to ensure clarity and consistency.  
Adhering to these guidelines will facilitate smoother reviews and better communication among team members.

## Title

The title of a pull request should be concise and meaningful, summarizing the changes made.  
Keep the title within 72 characters to avoid truncation by GitHub.  
Avoid including references to tracking systems (e.g., Jira task IDs) in the title, as they can clutter it and may not be useful for external reviewers.

## Description

The description of a pull request should provide a detailed explanation of the changes made, the reasons for those changes, and any relevant context.  
It should include:

- A summary of the problem being solved or the feature being added
- If applicable, include a reference to the tracking system at the end of the description using `Resolves: <Jira task ID>` (e.g., `Resolves: DX-1234`)
