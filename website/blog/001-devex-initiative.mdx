# DevEx Initiative: Transforming the Development Experience at PagoPA

Imagine being able to release the first API for a **new** digital service into
production in minutes instead of weeks, having fewer decisions to make, and less
code to interpret and maintain, and onboarding new team members with zero
downtime: this is the goal we set for ourselves with the **Developer Experience
([DevEx](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/861732865/DevEx+Lab+-+Initiative+canvas))**
initiative.

At the heart of the Engineering area, a group of Senior, Cloud, and Staff
Engineers has decided to tackle the daily challenges that slow down our work.
We're here to break down barriers, simplify processes, and make software
development smoother and more rewarding for everyone.

## Why DevEx

How much time is lost before even writing a line of code? How many decisions
need to be made? And how long does it take for a new engineer to become truly
productive?

With DevEx, we want to answer these questions and solve the problems that hinder
our daily work:

- **Reduce downtime:** Every second spent configuring an environment or
  interpreting old code is a second lost to innovation.
- **Lower cognitive load**: Less complexity means more room to create value,
  reducing errors, and speeding up time-to-market
- **Speed up onboarding:** Every new developer should be able to contribute from
  day one.

## What We Do

The [DevEx team](https://github.com/orgs/pagopa/teams/engineering-team-devex)
doesn't just identify problems and suggest solutions: they tackle them head-on,
getting their hands dirty.

- **Common patterns and golden paths:** We provide tried-and-true paths so you
  don't have to reinvent the wheel every time.
- **Ready-to-use abstractions and tools:** We reduce boilerplate code so you can
  focus on the code that matters.
- **Optimized development environments:** Pre-configured and ready to use
  because infrastructure should never be an obstacle but a resource.
- **Centralized documentation:** You'll no longer have to search for an answer;
  it will always be at your fingertips.

## How We're Organized

Currently, the DevEx initiative is carried out by engineers working
asynchronously on a _best-effort_ basis. It may not always be this way, but for
now, it seems to be working!

![Team DevEx](./001-images/image-4.png)

Every two weeks, we hold a review & demo session on Google Meet. This is a key
moment to review our goals
([OKRs](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/962757129/OKR)) and
share our progress. Each member autonomously selects a task from the
[Jira DevEx Board](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DEVEX/boards/501/backlog)
and carries it forward, collaborating with the rest of the team through Code
Reviews and RFCs.

Staff Engineers, in particular, are expected to independently select priority
tasks beyond the scope of the project (domain) they are already engaged in. This
approach requires **collaboration from Product Managers** to ensure that
activities are aligned with strategic business objectives.

Innovation doesn't stop at theory: we bring solutions directly into projects,
proactively supporting stream-aligned teams, and promoting the adoption of DX
tools.

## Where We Stand

We started with an idea and a
[brainstorming session](https://www.figma.com/board/7rmB4tXRQlzfStPuJh4vU2/Kick-Off?node-id=0-1&t=UZeTC0BhIFl9678h-0),
then we got to work.

Between April and July 2024, we have...

- Identified
  [shared technologies and patterns](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/947782090/RFC-DX-001+Scelta+del+primo+stack+tecnologico)
  to focus our initial efforts on, currently: Typescript, Terraform, Azure, and
  GitHub Actions.

- Established some new practices such as:

  - [naming conventions](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/1032880258/RFC-DX-005+Naming+convention+nuove+risorse+Azure)
    for Azure resources
  - structure for
    [npm tasks for Typescript projects](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/1012662333/RFC-DX-004+Package+scripts)
  - [HCL code structure for Terraform modules](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/910492147/RFC-DX-011+Riorganizzazione+configurazioni+Terraform)

- Implemented new Terraform modules for:

  - [creating a GitHub Actions runner](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/modules/github_selfhosted_runner_on_container_app_jobs)
  - [setting up GitHub repository identity on Azure](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/modules/azure_federated_identity_with_github)
  - [easily creating roles and permissions for Azure services](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/modules/azure_role_assignments)
  - [creating an Azure Functions App](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/modules/azure_function_app)
  - [creating an Azure App Service](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/modules/azure_app_service)
  - [setting up autoscaling for an App Service or Function App](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/tree/main/infra/modules/azure_app_service_plan_autoscaler)

- Developed GitHub Actions for:

  - [conducting code reviews on Typescript codebases](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/js_code_review.yaml)
  - [building Docker images](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker_image_build.yaml)
  - [deploying Azure services via Terraform](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/infra_apply.yaml)
  - [planning infrastructure changes](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/infra_plan.yaml)
  - [notifying of drifts between IaC code and infrastructure](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/infra_drift_detection.yml)
  - [deploying to production Azure Function or App Service](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/web_app_deploy.yaml)
  - [linting Terraform code](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/.github/workflows/static_analysis.yaml)

- Set up
  [basic configurations for Typescript tooling](https://github.com/pagopa/dx-typescript):
  eslint, yarn, turbo, changeset.

- Shared the
  [results of a benchmark on tools for generating clients from OpenAPI specifications](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/1100579051/RFC-DX-009+Benchmark+per+generatori+di+codice+Typescript+da+OpenAPI)

- Analyzed the state of the art for
  [distributed monitoring and log correlation on Azure](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DevEx/pages/1086619751/Azure+e+tracing+per+applicativi+NodeJS)

While it may seem like a lot of material, we recognize that without proper
documentation and effective communication, our efforts might be overlooked.
That's why We've launched a
[dedicated website](https://pagopa.github.io/dx/docs/) to be populated with
content and continuously updated as a reference for all engineers in the
organization.

And that's not all! We're also working to provide tools (_scaffolding_) that can
automate repetitive and redundant tasks.

:::info

We want to reach a point where documentation becomes unnecessary!

## Pilot Projects

Although still in its early stages, much of the tooling we’ve developed has
already been successfully used in several real projects.

Here are some examples!

### Trial System

The team that implemented the Trial System used DevEx tooling to create a
platform that allows any digital service to segment users and test new features
on a selected group (feature flags):

https://github.com/pagopa/trial-system

### IO FIMS

IO FIMS is a project that manages Single Sign-On for IO users. The team used
DevEx tooling to create a new service:

https://github.com/pagopa/io-fims

### IO communication

The team that implemented the messaging service for IO used DevEx tooling to
create a new Typescript monorepo and manage the deployment of Azure Functions:

https://github.com/pagopa/io-messages

### IO authentication

The team that implemented the user authentication service for IO used DevEx
tooling to create a new Typescript monorepo and manage the deployment of Azure
Functions:

https://github.com/pagopa/io-auth-n-identity-domain

### IO entities and services

The team that implemented the backoffice for entities in IO used DevEx tooling
to manage the deployment of infrastructure and Azure Functions:

https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apagopa%2Fio-services-cms+pagopa%2Fdx&type=code

## Current Benefits of DevEx
