Enable `pnpm` and configure `pnpm-plugin-pagopa`

With this change, the generated monorepo will use `pnpm` as package manager and will be configured to use `pnpm-plugin-pagopa`.  
You can find more information about `pnpm-plugin-pagopa` [here](https://github.com/pagopa/dx/blob/main/packages/pnpm-plugin-pagopa/README.md).
