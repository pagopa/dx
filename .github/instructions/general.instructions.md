# General Instructions for Code Generation

Never commit code or open pull requests without being asked to do so.

## Pull Request Title and Description

When generating pull request titles and descriptions, follow these guidelines:

- Keep the subject line concise, ideally under 50 characters
- Never exceed 72 characters
- Use descriptive pull request titles that explain the purpose of the change
- Avoid generic titles like "Update code" or "Fix bug", be specific about the reason for the change

## Copilot Guidelines for Commit Messages

When generating commit messages, follow these guidelines:

- Capitalize the subject line
- Don't put a period at the end of the subject line
- Use the imperative mood
- Try to describe the rationale behind the changes instead of the changes themselves
- Avoid generic messages like "Refactor code to improve readability", be specific about the reason for the refactor
