# 6. We start with typescript and azure

Date: 2024-06-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current technological ecosystem within the engineering projects is
fragmented. Various languages (e.g., Java, TypeScript) and infrastructures
(e.g., Azure, AWS) are in use. To streamline the developer experience and
enhance productivity, it is crucial to decide on a specific technology stack to
begin with.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt TypeScript and Azure as the initial technology stack
for the following reasons:

1. **Prevalence Among Teams**: A significant number of teams within the
   engineering area are already utilizing TypeScript and Azure. This prevalence
   indicates a familiarity and comfort level with these technologies, which will
   facilitate smoother adoption and quicker ramp-up times.
1. **Engineer Utilization**: The majority of engineers in the area are currently
   working with TypeScript and Azure. Leveraging their existing expertise will
   minimize the learning curve, reduce training costs, and accelerate the
   production and sharing of software artifacts such as templates and
   scaffolders.

## Consequences

By starting with a common stack, we lay a scalable foundation for future
projects and technological decisions, ensuring consistency and compatibility
across various initiatives.

Training new hires and onboarding will be more streamlined, as there will be a
clear, consistent set of technologies to learn and use.

By making this decision, we aim to enhance the developer experience, improve
project delivery times.
