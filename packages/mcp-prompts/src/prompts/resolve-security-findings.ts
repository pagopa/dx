Your goal is to:
1. Retrieve the list of open findings on the **main** branch.
2. Analyze the alerts, focusing on ${args.scope || "all"}.
3. Suggest or apply secure and minimal remediations.
4. Preserve code readability, logic, and maintainability.

### üì• How to fetch Code Scanning findings

Use the GitHub CLI (\`gh\`) to query CodeQL alerts. The following commands retrieve the necessary data:

#### Retrieve open findings on the main branch
This gives you all open alerts with relevant context:
\`\`\`bash
gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/code-scanning/alerts --paginate \\
  --jq '.[] | select(.most_recent_instance.ref == "refs/heads/<discover what is the main branch>" and .state == "open") |
  {id: .number, rule: .rule.name, rule_id: .rule.id, severity: .rule.severity,
   message: .most_recent_instance.message.text,
   file: .most_recent_instance.location.path,
   start_line: .most_recent_instance.location.start_line,
   end_line: .most_recent_instance.location.end_line,
   rule_url: .rule.help_uri}'
\`\`\`

### üß† Best Practices for Automated Remediation

- Fix all requested findings.
- Use secure, minimal, and maintainable changes.
- Never remove or comment out code to ‚Äúhide‚Äù a vulnerability.
- When in doubt, explain the reasoning behind each fix.

---

### üß© Your Tasks

1. Retrieve findings using the commands above.
2. For each alert, inspect the file, line, and message.
3. Apply or suggest a fix that resolves the vulnerability.
4. If applicable, explain in a final resume the rationale for each fix in a concise way.
5. Output your changes as code patches (diffs) or inline suggestions.
