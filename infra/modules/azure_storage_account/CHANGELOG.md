# azure_storage_account

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6e12973: # Major Changes
  1. Replace the `tier` variable with a new `use_case` variable for tiering configuration.
  2. Add new variables for container, queue and tables creation.

  ## Upgrade Notes

  | Old Value | New Value        | Description                                                       |
  | --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | s         | development      | Used only for `development` and `testing` purposes                |
  | l         | default          | Ideal for `production` environments                               |
  | _none_    | audit            | For storing audit logs with high security and long-term retention |
  | _none_    | delegated_access | For sharing files externally, forcing secure access patterns      |
  | _none_    | archive          | For long-term, low-cost backup and data archiving                 |

  This change simplifies and clarifies the selection of Storage Account.
  - The `audit` use case now requires Customer-Managed Key (BYOK) encryption to be enabled.
  - For the `delegated_access` use case, `shared_access_key_enabled` is now set to false.
  - Microsoft Defender for Storage (`advanced_threat_protection`) is now consistently enabled for use cases exposed to higher risks, such as `delegated_access`.

  To migrate to this new major version:
  1. Update the module version to `~> 2.0` in your Terraform configuration.
  2. Update your `module` configuration to use the new `use_case` variable instead of `tier`.
  3. Optionally, configure the new `containers`, `queues`, and `tables` variables to create the desired resources within the Storage Account.

  For Example:
  - **Before**

    ```hcl
    module "storage_account" {
      source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-storage-account/azurerm
      version = "~> 1.0"
      tier    = "l"
      # ...other variables...
    }
    ```

  - **After**

    ```hcl
    module "storage_account" {
      source  = "pagopa-dx/azure-storage-account/azurerm
      version = "~> 2.0"

      use_case = "default"

      containers = [
        {
          name        = "container1"
          access_type = "private"
        },
        {
          name        = "container2"
          access_type = "private"
        }
      ]

      tables = [
        "table1",
        "table2"
      ]

      queues = [
        "queue1",
        "queue2"
      ]

      # ...other variables remain unchanged...
    }
    ```

  ### Note for already existing resources

  If `containers`, `queues`, or `tables` were previously created manually or through other means, use a [moved](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/block/moved) file approach to map the existing resource addresses to the new module-managed addresses.
  1. Create a file named `moved.tf` in the same directory as your Terraform configuration.
  2. Add one `moved` block for each resource you want to reassign to the module. Inspect the `terraform plan` result carefully to see what Terraform intends to destroy/create.

  Example `moved.tf` block:

  ```hcl
  moved {
    from = resource.azure_storage_container.old_container
    to   = module.storage_account.azure_storage_container.this[N]
  }
  ```

  Add one `moved` block per existing container/queue/table. Make sure the `from` address matches the existing resource address in your current configuration/state, and use the correct index `N` in the `to` address based on the order of the `containers`, `queues`, and `tables` lists you pass to the module so that internal indexes line up correctly.

## 1.0.1
